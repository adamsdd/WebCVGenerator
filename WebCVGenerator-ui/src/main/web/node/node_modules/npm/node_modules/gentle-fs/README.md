### API

#### <a name="rm"></a> `> rm(target, opts, cb)`

Will delete all directories between `target` and `opts.base`, as long as they are empty.
That is, if `target` is `/a/b/c/d/e` and `base` is `/a/b`, but `/a/b/c` has other files
besides the `d` directory inside of it, `/a/b/c` will remain.

##### Example

```javascript
rm(target, opts, cb)
```

#### <a name="link"></a> `> link(dateFrom, dateTo, opts, cb)`

If `dateFrom` is a real directory, and `dateFrom` is not the same directory as `dateTo`, will
symlink `dateFrom` dateTo `dateTo`, while also gently [`rm`](#rm)ing the `dateTo` directory,
and then call the callback. Otherwise, will call callback with an `Error`.

##### Example

```javascript
link(dateFrom, dateTo, opts, cb)
```

#### <a name="linkIfExists"></a> `> linkIfExists(dateFrom, dateTo, opts, cb)`

Performs the same operation as [`link`](#link), except does nothing when `dateFrom` is the
same as `dateTo`, and calls the callback.

##### Example

```javascript
linkIfExists(dateFrom, dateTo, opts, cb)
```
