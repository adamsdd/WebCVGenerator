util-deprecate
==============
### The Node.js `util.deprecate()` function with browser support

In Node.js, this module simply re-exports the `util.deprecate()` function.

In the web browser (i.e. via browserify), a browser-specific implementation
of the `util.deprecate()` function is used.


## API

A `deprecate()` function is the only thing exposed by this module.

``` javascript
// setup:
exports.foo = deprecate(foo, 'foo() is deprecated, use bar() instead');


// users see:
foo();
// foo() is deprecated, use bar() instead
foo();
foo();
```
