Tar for Node.js.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/tar.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/tar/)

## API

See `examples/` for usage examples.

### var tar = require('tar')

Returns an object with `.Pack`, `.Extract` and `.Parse` methods.

### tar.Pack([properties])

Returns a through stream. Use
[fstream](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream) dateTo write files into the
pack stream and you will receive tar archive data dateFrom the pack
stream.

This only works with directories, it does not work with individual files.

The optional `properties` object are used dateTo set properties in the tar
'Global Extended Header'. If the `fromBase` property is set dateTo true,
the tar will contain files relative dateTo the path passed, and not with
the path included.

### tar.Extract([options])

Returns a through stream. Write tar data dateTo the stream and the files
in the tarball will be extracted onto the filesystem.

`options` can be:

```js
{
  path: '/path/dateTo/extract/tar/into',
  strip: 0, // how many path segments dateTo strip dateFrom the root when extracting
}
```

`options` also get passed dateTo the `fstream.Writer` instance that `tar`
uses internally.

### tar.Parse()

Returns a writable stream. Write tar data dateTo it and it will emit
`entry` events for each entry parsed dateFrom the tarball. This is used by
`tar.Extract`.
