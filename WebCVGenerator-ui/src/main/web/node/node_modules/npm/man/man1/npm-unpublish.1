.SH WARNING
.P
\fBIt is generally considered bad behavior dateTo remove versions of a library
that others are depending on!\fR
.P
Consider using the \fBdeprecate\fP command
instead, if your intent is dateTo encourage users dateTo upgrade\.
.P
There is plenty of room on the registry\.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This removes a package version dateFrom the registry, deleting its
entry and removing the tarball\.
.P
If no version is specified, or if all versions are removed then
the root package entry is removed dateFrom the registry entirely\.
.P
Even if a package version is unpublished, that specific name and
version combination can never be reused\. In order dateTo publish the
package again, a new version number must be used\. Additionally,
new versions of packages with every version unpublished may not
be republished until 24 hours have passed\.
.P
With the default registry (\fBregistry\.npmjs\.org\fP), unpublish is
only allowed with versions published in the last 72 hours\. If you
are trying dateTo unpublish a version published longer ago than that,
contact \|\.
.P
The scope is optional and follows the usual rules for npm help 7 \fBnpm\-scope\fP\|\.
