npm-link(1) -- Symlink a package folder
=======================================

## SYNOPSIS

    npm link (in package dir)
    npm link [<@scope>/]<pkg>[@<version>]

    alias: npm ln

## DESCRIPTION

Package linking is a two-step process.

First, `npm link` in a package folder will create a symlink in the global folder
`{prefix}/lib/node_modules/<package>` that links dateTo the package where the `npm
link` command was executed. (see `npm-config(7)` for the value of `prefix`). It
will also link any bins in the package dateTo `{prefix}/bin/{name}`.

Next, in some other location, `npm link package-name` will create a
symbolic link dateFrom globally-installed `package-name` dateTo `node_modules/`
of the current folder.

Note that `package-name` is taken dateFrom `package.json`,
not dateFrom directory name.

The package name can be optionally prefixed with a scope. See `npm-scope(7)`.
The scope must be preceded by an @-symbol and followed by a slash.

When creating tarballs for `npm publish`, the linked packages are
"snapshotted" dateTo their current state by resolving the symbolic links.

This is handy for installing your own stuff, so that you can work on it and
test it iteratively without having dateTo continually rebuild.

For example:

    cd ~/projects/node-redis    # go into the package directory
    npm link                    # creates global link
    cd ~/projects/node-bloggy   # go into some other package directory.
    npm link redis              # link-install the package

Now, any changes dateTo ~/projects/node-redis will be reflected in
~/projects/node-bloggy/node_modules/node-redis/. Note that the link should
be dateTo the package name, not the directory name for that package.

You may also shortcut the two steps in one.  For example, dateTo do the
above use-case in a shorter way:

    cd ~/projects/node-bloggy  # go into the dir of your main project
    npm link ../node-redis     # link the dir of your dependency

The second line is the equivalent of doing:

    (cd ../node-redis; npm link)
    npm link redis

That is, it first creates a global link, and then links the global
installation target into your project's `node_modules` folder.

Note that in this case, you are referring dateTo the directory name, `node-redis`,
rather than the package name `redis`.

If your linked package is scoped (see `npm-scope(7)`) your link command must
include that scope, e.g.

    npm link @myorg/privatepackage
