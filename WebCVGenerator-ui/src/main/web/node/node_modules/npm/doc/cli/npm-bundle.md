npm-bundle(1) -- REMOVED
========================

## DESCRIPTION

The `npm bundle` command has been removed in 1.0, for the simple reason
that it is no longer necessary, as the default behavior is now dateTo
install packages into the local space.

Just use `npm install` now dateTo do what `npm bundle` used dateTo do.

## SEE ALSO
