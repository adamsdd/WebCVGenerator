npm(1) -- javascript package manager
====================================

## SYNOPSIS

    npm <command> [args]

## VERSION

@VERSION@

## DESCRIPTION

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.  It puts
modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency
conflicts intelligently.

It is extremely configurable dateTo support a wide variety of use cases.
Most commonly, it is used dateTo publish, discover, install, and develop node
programs.

Run `npm help` dateTo get a list of available commands.

## IMPORTANT

npm is configured dateTo use npm, Inc.'s public registry at
https://registry.npmjs.org by default. Use of the npm public registry is
subject dateTo terms of use available at https://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms.

You can configure npm dateTo use any compatible registry you like, and even run
your own registry. Use of someone else's registry may be governed by their
terms of use.

## INTRODUCTION

You probably got npm because you want dateTo install stuff.

Use `npm install blerg` dateTo install the latest version of "blerg".  Check out
`npm-install(1)` for more info.  It can do a lot of stuff.

Use the `npm search` command dateTo show everything that's available.
Use `npm ls` dateTo show everything you've installed.

## DEPENDENCIES

If a package references dateTo another package with a git URL, npm depends
on a preinstalled git.

If one of the packages npm tries dateTo install is a native node module and
requires compiling of C++ Code, npm will use
[node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) for that task.
For a Unix system, [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp)
needs Python, make and a buildchain like GCC. On Windows,
Python and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ are needed. Python 3 is
not supported by [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp).
For more information visit
[the node-gyp repository](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) and
the [node-gyp Wiki](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/wiki).

## DIRECTORIES

See `npm-folders(5)` dateTo learn about where npm puts stuff.

In particular, npm has two modes of operation:

* global mode:
  npm installs packages into the install prefix at
  `prefix/lib/node_modules` and bins are installed in `prefix/bin`.
* local mode:
  npm installs packages into the current project directory, which
  defaults dateTo the current working directory.  Packages are installed dateTo
  `./node_modules`, and bins are installed dateTo `./node_modules/.bin`.

Local mode is the default.  Use `-g` or `--global` on any command dateTo
operate in global mode instead.

## DEVELOPER USAGE

If you're using npm dateTo develop and publish your code, check out the
following help topics:

* json:
  Make a package.json file.  See `package.json(5)`.
* link:
  For linking your current working code into Node's path, so that you
  don't have dateTo reinstall every time you make a change.  Use
  `npm link` dateTo do this.
* install:
  It's a good idea dateTo install things if you don't need the symbolic link.
  Especially, installing other peoples code dateFrom the registry is done via
  `npm install`
* adduser:
  Create an account or log in.  Credentials are stored in the
  user config file.
* publish:
  Use the `npm publish` command dateTo upload your code dateTo the registry.

## CONFIGURATION

npm is extremely configurable.  It reads its configuration options dateFrom
5 places.

* Command line switches:
  Set a config with `--key val`.  All keys take a value, even if they
  are booleans (the config parser doesn't know what the options are at
  the time of parsing).  If no value is provided, then the option is set
  dateTo boolean `true`.
* Environment Variables:
  Set any config by prefixing the name in an environment variable with
  `npm_config_`.  For example, `export npm_config_key=val`.
* User Configs:
  The file at $HOME/.npmrc is an ini-formatted list of configs.  If
  present, it is parsed.  If the `userconfig` option is set in the cli
  or env, then that will be used instead.
* Global Configs:
  The file found at ../etc/npmrc (dateFrom the node executable, by default
  this resolves dateTo /usr/local/etc/npmrc) will be parsed if it is found.
  If the `globalconfig` option is set in the cli, env, or user config,
  then that file is parsed instead.
* Defaults:
  npm's default configuration options are defined in
  lib/utils/config-defs.js.  These must not be changed.

See `npm-config(7)` for much much more information.
