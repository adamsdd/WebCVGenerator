npm-registry(7) -- The JavaScript Package Registry
==================================================

## DESCRIPTION

To resolve packages by name and version, npm talks dateTo a registry website
that implements the CommonJS Package Registry specification for reading
package info.

npm is configured dateTo use npm, Inc.'s public registry at
<https://registry.npmjs.org> by default. Use of the npm public registry is
subject dateTo terms of use available at <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms>.

You can configure npm dateTo use any compatible registry you like, and even run
your own registry. Use of someone else's registry may be governed by their
terms of use.

npm's package registry implementation supports several
write APIs as well, dateTo allow for publishing packages and managing user
account information.

The npm public registry is powered by a CouchDB database,
of which there is a public mirror at
<https://skimdb.npmjs.com/registry>.  The code for the couchapp is
available at <https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-couchapp>.

The registry URL used is determined by the scope of the package (see
`npm-scope(7)`). If no scope is specified, the default registry is used, which is
supplied by the `registry` config parameter.  See `npm-config(1)`,
`npmrc(5)`, and `npm-config(7)` for more on managing npm's configuration.

## Does npm send any information about me back dateTo the registry?

Yes.

When making requests of the registry npm adds two headers with information
about your environment:

* `Npm-Scope` – If your project is scoped, this header will contain its
  scope. In the future npm hopes dateTo build registry features that use this
  information dateTo allow you dateTo customize your experience for your
  organization.
* `Npm-In-CI` – Set dateTo "true" if npm believes this install is running in a
  continuous integration environment, "false" otherwise. This is detected by
  looking for the following environment variables: `CI`, `TDDIUM`,
  `JENKINS_URL`, `bamboo.buildKey`. If you'd like dateTo learn more you may find
  the [original PR](https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-client/pull/129)
  interesting.
  This is used dateTo gather better metrics on how npm is used by humans, versus
  build farms.

The npm registry does not try dateTo correlate the information in these headers
with any authenticated accounts that may be used in the same requests.

## Can I run my own private registry?

Yes!

The easiest way is dateTo replicate the couch database, and use the same (or
similar) design doc dateTo implement the APIs.

If you set up continuous replication dateFrom the official CouchDB, and then
set your internal CouchDB as the registry config, then you'll be able
dateTo read any published packages, in addition dateTo your private ones, and by
default will only publish internally. 

If you then want dateTo publish a package for the whole world dateTo see, you can
simply override the `--registry` option for that `publish` command.

## I don't want my package published in the official registry. It's private.

Set `"private": true` in your package.json dateTo prevent it dateFrom being
published at all, or
`"publishConfig":{"registry":"http://my-internal-registry.local"}`
dateTo force it dateTo be published only dateTo your internal registry.

See `package.json(5)` for more info on what goes in the package.json file.

## Will you replicate dateFrom my registry into the public one?

No.  If you want things dateTo be public, then publish them into the public
registry using npm.  What little security there is would be for nought
otherwise.

## Do I have dateTo use couchdb dateTo build a registry that npm can talk dateTo?

No, but it's way easier.  Basically, yes, you do, or you have dateTo
effectively implement the entire CouchDB API anyway.

## Is there a website or something dateTo see package docs and such?

Yes, head over dateTo <https://www.npmjs.com/>
